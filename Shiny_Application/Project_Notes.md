Brief Notes:

This project was spurred by news of legal contestation over the practice of airbnb hosting in New York City over the past five years thereabouts. I was curious to see what the state of the airbnb market was in New York City and to discern any interesting patterns in listing distribution geographically or otherwise. While some patterns emerged from the data, the consistently weak negative correlation between most variables indicated the fact that the chosen data set is insufficient to the task of answering some of the more interesting questions I had about airbnb hosting in New York City and its effects on the law and on the rental market. Barring correlation inversion via Simpson's Paradox, I believe any hypothesis testing for variables on this dataset will yield generally negative results.
